// typeof is a reserved keyword in JavaScript that does exactly what it says: it returns the type of the value in question. The proper 
// syntax is typeof x

// Using typeof on x, y, and z would return "number", "string", and "boolean". Other types that can be returned are function, 
// object, and undefined. When dealing with a value that MUST be a specific type, it can be very helpful to pass it through typeof 
// first in order to verify the type. You can then use conditionals to determine the correct option for the code for that value type.
