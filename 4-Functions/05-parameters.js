//Key Points
// We'll get a lot more practice with parameters in the future. The key takeaways are these points:
// Parameters are like variables.
// Declared in the parenthesis of a function.
// The arguments are the values that get assigned to the parameters when the function is called.



//A parameter is a variable in a method definition. When a method is called, the arguments are the data you pass into the method's 
//parameters. To say it again, a parameter is the variable in the declaration of the function. An argument is the actual value of 
//this variable that gets passed to function.
